They were definitely better in 2023 than in 2022 (where they were last in consensus) but in both of these seasons, the run blocking grades were pretty average. In 2023, it was 18th in the league. Aaron Brewer is the biggest victim of being one-sided. Terrible in Pass Pro, but pretty good in Run Blocking. Much like the Titans OL. \n\nAnd Achane has the talent and speed, but at least compared to Mostert, his workload was very light, and the boxes/blocking he saw early in the season were very favorable. He dropped after the return from injury. \n\nI just don\u2019t these rankings will be broad. Especially since Scherff (of all people) was given an honorable mention and that James Cook was top 100. But, we\u2019ll probably not see Lawrence or Etienne make the top 100 and I find that to be pretty asinine (2 guys that I find to be top 10 their position)."}

He was still kinda rehabing from his ACL injury from 2020 but by the middle of the season he was essentially Bakhtiari of old. The Jets were really pushing us packaging him with Aaron but the feeling was giving them multiple potential All-Pro players was too much. He was slated to be the honest full time starter in 2023 but got hurt in the first week. After that people were looking at his contract and were like \"ok yeah he's probably gonna get cut in the offseason\" but that was not the case entering Chicago last season\n\nI think it's fair to say that losing him wasn't quite as big of a deal as it could have been because a) the Packers had experience working with a Bakhtiari-less OL with much of the same linemen and b) those OL were on the whole pretty good, especially Jenkins who made our Top 100 list. But Bakh was still seen as a very important player to have on the team and could have been a real difference maker. Yeah the Packers OL as a unit graded alright, but man I wish we had a healthy Bakh on the field instead of Sean Rhyan or a Yosh Nijman at times.

So what you\u2019re saying is that Love almost never turned it over unless he was behind late and trying to mount a comeback on a team with literally zero veteran WRs or TEs to lean on in crunch time. How is that a bad thing, exactly? And again, he had two *fewer* turnovers than Goff on the year, and four more TDs. And it\u2019s not like he failed every time in those situations. He had 3 game winning drives and 2 4th quarter comebacks on the year, numbers that are identical to Goff.

For the whole season he had a second guy blanketing him, which was fine the year before because the run game was actually working for parts of last season. This year it didn\u2019t work until Jacobs got hurt in November/ December.  dude had a first time play caller who was awful with a rookie Qb / Jimmy G/ Hoyer sharing the job of throwing him the ball. For large parts of the game our rookie play caller would just forget about Tae, which is when our offence struggled the most, or do the exact opposite of completely force it to him in double teams when it made no sense. I just don\u2019t think his performance last season warranted a 60 place drop in the list, when he was really good last season, and still put up great numbers, and completely passed the eye test of being a true number 1 Wr. I would\u2019ve been fine with a minor drop on the list, maybe 30 spots, but 60 is egregious considering the gaps of talent around him. \n\nI don\u2019t fully disagree with your point on Goff vs Love, Goff defo had the better weapons. I\u2019d argue that Green Bays coach/ play caller are just as strong, maybe a little stronger than the Lions coach/ offensive play caller tho, so I just looked at it as a wash of one guy having better coaching with the other having better weapons to throw to."}

{"text": "You know that Utah State was 5 years ago, right? And I won\u2019t even get into the football terrorist who coached his final year there. It is flat out inaccurate to claim that Love struggles with his progressions to any significant degree. Does an 8 year veteran with 117 career starts get through his reads better? Sure, I\u2019ll give you that. But Love has plenty of tools that far outpace Goff\u2019s."}
{"text": "He might be a top 10 QB, but that doesn't make him a top 100 player. And I don't even call him a top 10 QB. I think he showed promise the second half of the year."}

{"text": "Definitely agree with you that the context is important. There's just so much receiver talent in the league right now, it's hard to stay high on these kinds of lists.

Goff for MVP."}
{"text": "Honorable mention in 2018 is wild. He had near MVP numbers"}
{"text": "He was right behind Mahomes and Brees after the Chiefs game! Then the Lions and Bears games happened.\n\nHe definitely should have still made the top 100, though."}

{"text": ">at the same time he is playing good ball.\n\nPeople use \"system QB\" as a knock, but Goff with an OC that doesnt go \"maybe we should fuck and chuck every passing attempt\" is a top end QB.  \n\nHe's not the all downfield all the time QB, but with motion support?   Dude is really good."}

{"text": "Stated another way - if Miami had signed Henry during the offseason and put up the exact same numbers as Mostert did, the rankers would have had him in the top 30.\n\nCase in point - James Conner had very similar OL Run Block grades & bad QB situation, put up nearly a full additional yard per carry and more yards per game.  I'll be surprised if he was ranked at all, much less in the same ballpark as Henry."}
{"text": "Absolutely.\n \nI\u2019d feel the exact same way if I was watching a Lions game and was subjected to him."}
{"text": "No problem! He actually had another surgery this offseason and is hoping that fixes his issues. I hope the guy gets another chance. He\u2019s still only 32 and we\u2019ve seen tackles excel late into their 30s. And he was still fantastic whenever he managed to make it onto the field. There\u2019s some small chance that a team picks him up in training camp for cheap and gets a massive steal. But it won\u2019t be the Packers."}
{"text": "Utah State being 5 years ago doesn't mean it isn't still his biggest flaw, it was a huge part of the reason he struggled for half of the season. The dude locks onto his first target, whether you accept that or not"}
{"text": "He was statistically the best QB in the NFL after week 9, that's a lot more than showed promise lmao"}
{"text": "So what?  Irrelevant"}
{"text": "So talking about flaws Jordan Love has had for 5 years is awful because 5 years is such a long time but somehow Carr's 2017 season means Love is better than Goff?"}
{"text": "Because Love only had 14 turnovers on the entire season. This thread is all about comparing him to Goff, who had 2 **more** TOs than Love (16) and also 4 fewer total TDs (36 to 32). In the context of a player who turned it over less than once a game in his first season starting, I think it\u2019s a green flag that a decent percentage of the turnovers he did have came trailing late in games. That means when he doesn\u2019t have to force things he\u2019s extremely careful with the ball. Aaron Rodgers had a very similar issue his first year starting and won only 6 games with a better team around him. I think that turned out ok."}
{"text": "Because the score is a team stat and a last drive when you\u2019re down TO isn\u2019t as damning as others? It\u2019s you trying to pry victory out of defeat with hero ball. Sometimes it works often it fails but it\u2019s not a huge flaw for the QB as much as throwing ints at other times, which Goff was more likely to do."}
{"text": "I understand your point; I just didn't want to get too down into caveats when I was just trying to correct the record with the actual numbers.\n\nI still think he earns a bit of a black mark for the end of that game because his possession before that is when he threw his other INT in that game; same score and almost identical down/distance/field position just with 3:32 left instead of 0:03. If he just threw incompletions instead at the end of those drives we could have kicked two field goals to win the game."}
{"text": "And in fact, Love is the only QB to ever fail to complete a game winning drive in the 4th quarter. Sad!"}
{"text": "Don\u2019t disagree. In fact I have salt of my own lol. They almost took out Dak in week 17."}
{"text": "Sure but what I\u2019m saying is that Keenan\u2019s season was better than Davante\u2019s season even when you *don\u2019t* consider how many games they played. If Keenan played the last 5 games and did not catch a single pass in any of them, he should still be ranked above Davante."}
{"text": "Thanks Krimzy, appreciate ya."}
{"text": "Doesn\u2019t shock me at all."}
{"text": "Being in the MVP race/talks and actually getting votes are different things"}
{"text": "Yeah but everyone saw that it wasn't him."}
{"text": "You can't have any discussion with a NFCN fan with a Packers flair they just downvote"}
{"text": "Yet it's heavily implied here since the only stat Goff has on Love is wins and an extra 20 yards a game."}
{"text": "Oh hell yeah, you already know we'd be praising Henry and use it as an excuse to not rank Tua. Fair point.\n\nAnd I think your example with Conner is valid as well."}
{"text": "he kinda sounds like our center Frank Ragnow, who\u2019s pretty much got a permanent toe injury"}
{"text": "You sound like Billy Madison talking about business ethics"}
{"text": "Goff can\u2019t throw the ball without a squeaky clean pocket and thats now not when he was a sophomore in college"}
{"text": "Nope, that's exactly what showing promise is. Let's see how he does next year before putting him in the HoF."}
{"text": "Just feels weird to suggest that Carr has always been some scrub (floundering for years) as if Goff has routinely been better. They've probably had similar peaks, in fact I'd say Carr's best season is better than Goff's. \n\nGoff was run out of town and the Rams practically paid to get rid of him. He's had a resurgence with a stacked Lions roster. He's been good. Definitely don't wanna take that from him. But a Lions fan acting high and mighty as if Detroit Goff is substantially better than Oakland Carr seems a little silly at this point, to me. \n\n/u/imposingthanos makes a pretty good point, imo. At least a fair comparison anyway."}
{"text": "I don't know what you're on about. I don't think anything about Carr means anything about Love and Goff. Not sure what you're twisting at here. \n\nLove was a first year starter this year. Goff is a seven year starter (8 if you wanna count him starting 7 games his rookie year). Love threw more touchdowns, less picks and had four hundred less yards. He ran for 220 more yards and had two more rushing touchdowns. So on the whole they had similar yardage output, Love had four more total touchdowns and less total turnovers. \n\nGoff had a 97 passer rating. Love had a 96 passer rating. They had similar seasons. Love did it in his first year as a starting QB with the youngest roster in the league and far less talent. The Lions meanwhile are pretty stacked on offense with Amon-Ra, LaPorta, Sewell, Gibbs. Who would each be the best player on the Packers offense (maybe not Gibbs but he wouldn't be worse than 3rd). Even each guy's advanced numbers are pretty identical to one another.\n\nSo yeah it doesn't seem crazy to me that Love is better than Goff in 2023. Because Love put up about the same-if-not-slightly-better numbers with a significantly worse supporting cast. And again did it in his first year playing while Goff has had seven or eight as a starter. Love also was significantly better than Goff in the final eight games of the year by just about whatever metric you wanna choose. \n\nI don't think anything about Carr means anything about Love in relation to Goff. Weird take. I just don't think that Goff has been substantially better than Carr throughout their respective careers. Carr's peak was probably better than Goff's. Goff is having a resurgence on a good team and that's good for him. He was good last year. Check my ranker sheet and you'll see I had Goff ranked ahead of Love. But it's weird to act like this is some travesty. Or that Goff is somehow an upper echelon QB and not a known quantity, middle-aged solid but not amazing QB. Like /u/imposingthanos pointed out to start with."}
{"text": "Yeah that's still not great if he threw a pick the drive before.\nI just don't like boiling it all down to how many games ended with a turnover. As if it's better to get blown out like in week 4 or turn over on downs like in week 2."}
{"text": "THE MAN MUST BE STOPPED!"}
{"text": "Boy did I learn that lesson last year."}
{"text": "Valid take as long as you weren't in the Purdy for MVP group last season . . ."}
{"text": "Dudes never had a bad season in his career but it wasn't him lol. \n\n4000 yards and 25 touchdowns is an average season for Goff. He was underrated then and still is."}
{"text": "Yeah that\u2019s not a bad comparison. I don\u2019t remember exactly what surgery he got now, but he did throw a little shade at the Packers by saying he should have gotten it right when he was hurt. Hopefully it fixes the issue now, but who knows."}
{"text": "That was actually Eric Gordon, the guy who was trying to take over the business instead of Billy Madison, who had the business ethics question and pulled the gun when he couldn't answer."}
{"text": "*leans in for a kiss*"}
{"text": "Like i don't really care too much  about the discussion you are having with the other dude about Love vs Goff or whatever. \n\n> The Lions meanwhile are pretty stacked on offense with Amon-Ra, LaPorta, Sewell, Gibbs.\n\n\n\nI would like to mention at least that i do thinkthat it's a bit unfair to mention LaPorta and Gibbs when they were rookies. We didn't know how they'd end up doing. \n\n\nSidenote, I like Reed and Wicks and both your TE's."}
{"text": "It wasn\u2019t Kerby Joseph though. It was Aidan Hutchinson on a near hip drop tackle that only didn\u2019t connect because our right tackle caught Dak in his fall."}
